🎯 CURRENT STATUS - ANALYSIS:
============================
🔍 Testing privacy group access controls across nodes
🔍 Checking individual identity isolation
💡 Privacy groups created on specific nodes - cross-node access varies
📋 Individual identity enforcement depends on privacy group configuration

🎯 CONCLUSION: Privacy enforcement varies by node configuration and group membership
