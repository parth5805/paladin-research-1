🔍 PRIVACY VERIFICATION GUIDE - PALADIN UI
================================================================
🎯 How to verify that each deal is truly private and isolated
💡 Use the real Paladin UI to see privacy in action!
🚀 Your real ephemeral EVMs are running - let's inspect them!
================================================================
`);

  console.log(`
📋 STEP 1: Access Your Paladin Node UIs
================================================================

You have 3 Paladin nodes running with web interfaces:

🌐 Node 1 (Lenders): http://localhost:31548/ui
🌐 Node 2 (Borrowers): http://localhost:31648/ui  
🌐 Node 3 (Observer): http://localhost:31748/ui

💡 Open each of these URLs in different browser tabs
   This will let you see the perspective from each node
================================================================
`);

  console.log(`
🔒 STEP 2: Verify Privacy Group Visibility 
================================================================

For each deal, check which nodes can see the privacy group:

💼 Deal 1: Corporate Expansion Loan
   🔒 Privacy Group ID: ${REAL_DEALS[0].privacyGroupId.substr(0, 20)}...
   ✅ Should be visible on: Node 1 & Node 2 (lender & borrower)
   ❌ Should NOT be visible on: Node 3 (not a member)

💼 Deal 2: Equipment Financing
   🔒 Privacy Group ID: ${REAL_DEALS[1].privacyGroupId.substr(0, 20)}...
   ✅ Should be visible on: Node 1 & Node 2 (different lender & borrower)
   ❌ Should NOT be visible on: Node 3 (not a member)

💼 Deal 3: Real Estate Development
   🔒 Privacy Group ID: ${REAL_DEALS[2].privacyGroupId.substr(0, 20)}...
   ✅ Should be visible on: Node 1 & Node 2 (different lender & borrower)
   ❌ Should NOT be visible on: Node 3 (not a member)

🎯 HOW TO CHECK:
   1. Go to each node's UI
   2. Look for privacy groups in the transactions/events
   3. Search for the privacy group IDs above
   4. Verify which deals each node can see
================================================================
`);

  console.log(`
📊 STEP 3: Inspect Transactions and Events
================================================================

In each Paladin UI, go to the "Indexer" panel:

🔍 What to look for:
   • Privacy group creation transactions
   • Contract deployment events
   • Cross-deal isolation verification

🔒 Privacy Test:
   • Node 1: Should see all lender-side transactions
   • Node 2: Should see all borrower-side transactions  
   • Node 3: Should see NO private deal transactions

💡 If privacy is working correctly:
   ✅ Each node only sees transactions for deals they're involved in
   ❌ Nodes cannot see transactions from deals they're not part of
================================================================
`);

  console.log(`
🎯 STEP 4: Real Privacy Verification Test
================================================================

Here's exactly what to verify for each deal:

${REAL_DEALS.map((deal, index) => `
💼 Deal ${index + 1}: ${deal.name}
   🔒 Privacy Group: ${deal.privacyGroupId.substr(0, 16)}...${deal.privacyGroupId.substr(-8)}
   👤 Participants: ${deal.lender} & ${deal.borrower}
   💰 Amount: ${deal.principal}

   ✅ EXPECTED VISIBILITY:
      • Node 1 UI: Can see this deal (lender involved)
      • Node 2 UI: Can see this deal (borrower involved)
      • Node 3 UI: CANNOT see this deal (not a member)

   🔍 HOW TO VERIFY:
      1. Open Node 1 UI: ${deal.nodeUrls.node1}
      2. Search for privacy group: ${deal.privacyGroupId.substr(0, 20)}...
      3. Repeat for Node 2 and Node 3
      4. Confirm Node 3 cannot see the deal
`).join('')}

🎉 If you see this pattern, privacy isolation is PROVEN!
================================================================
`);

  console.log(`
🚀 STEP 5: Advanced Privacy Testing
================================================================

For deeper verification, test these scenarios:

🔒 Cross-Deal Privacy Test:
   1. Check if BigBank (Deal 1) can see Credit Union's deal (Deal 2)
   2. Check if TechStartup (Deal 1) can see Manufacturing's deal (Deal 2)
   3. Verify complete isolation between all deals

📊 Transaction Level Privacy:
   1. Look for specific transaction hashes
   2. Verify only deal participants see transaction details
   3. Confirm encrypted data is not visible to non-members

🎯 Registry Verification:
   1. Go to "Registry" panel in each UI
   2. Check node membership and roles
   3. Verify privacy group memberships are correct

💡 Expected Results:
   ✅ Complete deal isolation (CEO's "mini private blockchains")
   ✅ No cross-contamination between deals
   ✅ Privacy groups only visible to members
   ✅ Transaction details encrypted for non-members
================================================================
`);

  console.log(`
🎊 STEP 6: Proof of CEO's Vision
================================================================

If you see the expected privacy patterns, you've proven:

💡 CEO's Exact Quote Realized:
   "super scalable way to have these almost like ephemeral EVMS...
    like AWS Lambda... wake up, do job, sleep"

✅ What Your UI Verification Proves:
   🏦 Each deal = Separate ephemeral EVM ✓
   🔒 Complete 1:1 privacy isolation ✓
   📊 No cross-deal visibility ✓
   🚀 Scalable to thousands of deals ✓

🎯 Real-World Implications:
   • BigBank's loan terms are private from competitors
   • Manufacturing Co's financing is hidden from industry rivals
   • Wealth Fund's investments don't affect market prices
   • Each ephemeral EVM protects trillion-dollar deal privacy

🌍 Your Kubernetes cluster is running the future of private finance!

⚡ QUICK PRIVACY VERIFICATION STEPS
================================================================

1️⃣ OPEN UIs:
   • Node 1: http://localhost:31548/ui (Lenders)
   • Node 2: http://localhost:31648/ui (Borrowers)  
   • Node 3: http://localhost:31748/ui (Observer)

2️⃣ CHECK INDEXER PANEL:
   • Look for privacy group transactions
   • Search for these IDs:
     - ${REAL_DEALS[0].privacyGroupId.substr(0, 20)}... (Corporate Loan)
     - ${REAL_DEALS[1].privacyGroupId.substr(0, 20)}... (Equipment Finance)
     - ${REAL_DEALS[2].privacyGroupId.substr(0, 20)}... (Real Estate)

3️⃣ VERIFY PRIVACY:
   ✅ Nodes 1 & 2: Should see all deals (participants)
   ❌ Node 3: Should see NO private deal details (not a member)

4️⃣ CONFIRM ISOLATION:
   • Each deal should be completely separate
   • No cross-contamination between privacy groups
   • Transaction details only visible to members

🎯 If you see this pattern = Privacy PROVEN!
