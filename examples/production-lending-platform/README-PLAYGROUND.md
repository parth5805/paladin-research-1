## 🎮 Two Playground Versions

### 1. **Simple Playground** (`paladin-playground.html`)

- **Offline Demo**: Works without backend server
- **Simulated Results**: Shows expected behavior patterns
- **Perfect for**: Demos, presentations, understanding concepts
- **No Setup Required**: Just open in browser

### 2. **Live Playground** (`paladin-playground-live.html` + `playground-server.js`)

- **Real Integration**: Connects to actual Paladin nodes
- **Live Results**: Real contract deployments and interactions
- **Backend Required**: Needs Node.js server running
- **Perfect for**: Development, testing, real demonstrations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Simple Demo (No Setup)

```bash
# Just open in browser
open paladin-playground.html
```

### Option 2: Live Demo (Full Integration)

1. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install express cors @lfdecentralizedtrust-labs/paladin-sdk
```

2. **Make sure Paladin nodes are running**:
   - Node 1: http://localhost:31548
   - Node 2: http://localhost:31648
   - Node 3: http://localhost:31748

3. **Start the playground server**:

```bash
node playground-server.js
```

4. **Open playground**:

```bash
# Server will show: 🌐 Paladin Playground Server running at http://localhost:3000
open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. **Create EOAs**

- Select a node from the dropdown
- Click "Create EOA" to generate new individual identities
- Each EOA gets a unique address and identity string

### 2. **Create Privacy Groups**

- Enter a group name
- Select members (hold Ctrl for multiple selection)
- Click "Create Privacy Group"
- Real privacy group gets deployed with storage contract

### 3. **Test Interactions**

- Select a privacy group
- Choose an EOA (any EOA, not just members)
- Try writing/reading values
- Observe the different access patterns

## 🔍 Expected Behavior Patterns

### ✅ **Authorized Members**

- **Write**: ✅ Success
- **Read**: ✅ Success
- **Status**: Authorized member

### ⚠️ **Same-Node Non-Members**

- **Write**: ⚠️ Success (node-level access)
- **Read**: ⚠️ Success (node-level access)
- **Status**: Node-level privacy behavior

### ❌ **Different-Node EOAs**

- **Write**: ❌ Failed (privacy group not found)
- **Read**: ❌ Failed (privacy group not found)
- **Status**: Properly blocked

## 🎨 UI Features

### 🎨 **Visual Design**

- Gradient backgrounds and modern cards
- Color-coded status indicators
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional typography

### 📊 **Information Display**

- Node connection status
- EOA addresses and identities
- Privacy group details
- Contract addresses and group IDs
- Detailed interaction results

### 🔄 **Real-time Updates**

- Live connection status monitoring
- Instant UI updates after operations
- Loading states with spinners
- Comprehensive error handling

## 🧪 Perfect for Showcasing

### 👥 **Demo Scenarios**

1. **Basic Privacy**: Show authorized vs unauthorized access
2. **Node-Level Behavior**: Demonstrate same-node access patterns
3. **Cross-Node Isolation**: Show how different nodes are blocked
4. **Group Management**: Create multiple groups with different members

### 🎓 **Educational Value**

- **Visual Learning**: See privacy concepts in action
- **Interactive Testing**: Try different scenarios yourself
- **Real Results**: Understand actual Paladin behavior
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Learn from detailed result messages

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **Backend API** (`playground-server.js`)

- Express.js server with CORS support
- Real Paladin SDK integration
- RESTful API for all operations
- Proper error handling and validation

### **Frontend** (`paladin-playground-live.html`)

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Modern CSS with Grid and Flexbox
- Responsive design patterns
- Progressive enhancement

### **Storage Contract**

- Simple `store(uint256)` and `retrieve()` functions
- Deployed automatically in each privacy group
